# Java 6502 Emulator
 
This is a project I started because I wanted a place to write and test code for my Ben Eater 6502 kit. After seeing some other emulators written in C++ ~~(by sane people)~~, I tried downloading them but had trouble building them. So, I figured I would just write my own. It was a fun process, and was greatly helped by [OneLoneCoder's NES Emulator Tutorial](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

Some might ask, why write an emulator in Java? And I would respond: "Because no one else would." Sure, Java is terribly slow (more than 1000x slower than the original!), and the fact that Java's ```byte```s and ```short```s are a pain to work with because they're signed, but it's the language I'm best in so I don't care ;)

Feel free to fork it, improve it, whatever, just link back to here. Enjoy!
